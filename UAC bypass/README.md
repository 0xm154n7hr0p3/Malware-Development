# UAC Bypass

𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐢𝐜 𝐢𝐝𝐞𝐚 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐏𝐫𝐢𝐯 𝐄𝐬𝐜:

*Manipulating the Registry structure of an auto-elevate Process called Fodhelper, Utilizing Programmatic Identifiers (ProgIDs), to spawn cmd, rev shell, or any .exe we want with Higher Privileges.

𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐎𝐛𝐟𝐮𝐬𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧:

*Static Analysis: Encoding with b64=>xor the registry paths & functions
*Dynamic Analysis: Separating the execution of the exploit into two different processes (PowerShell and cmd) to change the behavior and confuse the AV.
 

Getting Higher Privileges in a machine can be chained with dangerous attacks, such as Disabling the AV, dumping LSASS, and much more!
